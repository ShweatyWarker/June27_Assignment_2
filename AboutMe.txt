I started using Logic Pro I think during Logic Pro 8
I was in a music program for like 6-8 months for
Pre-Production, Post-Production, and General Studio Technician
Skill building.
Everyingthing was on Logic Pro and I personally
hated Logic Pro.
My friends in the program who were using FL Studio
Would just pump out beats 10x faster than me it felt
like, same quality too if not better because 
tuning, fx and mastering was such plain english
on Fl Studio whereas Logic Pro you kind of needed
to know.
An example is FL Studio my buddy would add "echo"
to his snare hits giving more body to the beat
Whereas in Logic Pro you needed to pull dropdown
menues and find a reverb plugin than go through
some presets to find quote on quote "echo".
Now I see them as the same thing so it sounds 
silly but when I was 17 I never heard the word reverb
and it could have meant anything in the world than,
and yes reverb is more than echo reverb could be 
very dry with no echo just more relfection on a
sound or can be used to dull sharpness or many other
functions, but in FL Studio echo meant all those things
haha.
